Acquiring food at Princeton University takes time and effort - especially from off-campus vendors. 
Students yearn for Wawa quesadillas or drunk meal tenders after nights out, only to remain unfulfilled due to the distance or wait. 
The same dilemma exists for students in the midst of an intense study session or those too sick to leave their dorms. 
Princeton is unique in that a majority of students live on campus - out of reach for delivery services such as UberEats or Grubhub. 
DormDash Princeton aims to serve the campusâ€™s food delivery needs.
